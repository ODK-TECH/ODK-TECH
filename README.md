👋 Hi, I’m @ODK-TECH  
👀 I’m interested in using data to drive insights, solve complex problems, and build intelligent solutions.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning, and cloud-based data solutions.  
💞️ I want to collaborate on open-source projects, AI research, and real-world data science applications.
